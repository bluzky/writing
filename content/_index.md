# Critical thinking practice

## Key steps to practice critical thinking skills

1. **Understand your own biases:** Understand what your biases are and where they may affect how you deal with information.
2. **Question your assumptions:** Asking questions is perhaps the quintessential act of critical thinking. If you don’t know what questions to ask, or don’t ask the questions in the first place, you may as well not get the answer.
3. **Don’t take information on authority until you’ve investigated it yourself:** Use your instinct to investigate questionable pieces of information. If your gut isn’t satisfied with an explanation, ask the person to elaborate. If you don’t question a fact, read about it or test it yourself.
4. **Think several moves ahead:** Record your observations so that you are forced to spell out details and be explicit in what you recognize and see. As time passes, you will notice patterns in your thinking.
5. **Put yourself in others’ shoes:** Putting yourself in others’ shoes will help you imagine their motivations, aspirations, and turmoils.
6. **Improve your brain function:** Solve a problem a day, walk or exercise for about 30 minutes daily, and eat the right kind of food.
7. **Analyze the pressures you are facing:** Discover what pressure you are bowing to and think explicitly about whether or not to reject that pressure.
8. **Deal with your ego-centrism:** Once you identify egocentric thinking in operation, you can then work to replace it with more rational thought through systematic self-reflection.
9. **Re-shape your character:** Notice when you refuse to admit you are wrong, even in the face of glaring evidence that you are in fact wrong. Notice when you become defensive when another person tries to point out a deficiency in your work, or your thinking. Notice when your intellectual arrogance keeps you from learning.
10. **Analyze group influences on your life:** Closely analyze the behavior that is encouraged, and discouraged, in the groups to which you belong.
